    "# Project Pythia: GeoCAT-Comp\n",
    "Welcome. \n",

    "## Who are and what is GeoCAT\n",
    "GeoCAT is the Geoscience Community Analysis Toolkit. Note, it does not analyze the community, rather it is a community built set of analysis tools. \n",
    "\n",
    "Think of GeoCAT as a machine shop instead of a production line, lots of tools to modify or examine the data, but no predetermined outcome, you choose how to use which tools in which order. And hey, if you need another tool that isn't there, let us know and/or help us build it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This Project Pythia presentation won't be able to cover every tool in GeoCAT, so my goal is to show some things I think are interesting with the hope that you become a part of the contributing community.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Part one: Data Analysis tools\n",
    "The next two sections will showcase a recently released signal processing toolset. \n",
    "\n",
    "Meteorological data are often noisy with overlapping signals of various strengths. And since I find fourier analysis handy for fingerprinting data components, I wrote a superset of functionality from NCL into python for abstracting away the process of decomposition, fintering and recomposing the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the next few code blocks, we'll show how to extract specific signals from meteorological data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Focus\n",
    "We don't have time in a single hour to even give an overview of all of our tools in GeoCAT, and so I'll be presenting a couple of case studies in greater depth. We are likely to have additional tutorials on geoCAT tools. Please send us suggestions for tools you would like to see.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today we will be covering a fourier filtering tool, which we recently added to GeoCAT's toolset.\n",
    "[![readthedocs](https://img.shields.io/readthedocs/geocat-comp/latest.svg)](https://geocat-comp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_api/generated/geocat.comp.fourier_filters.fourier_filter.html#geocat.comp.fourier_filters.fourier_filter)\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have time at the end, we will also cover a linear regridding tool, one of the first tools we developed for GeoCAT."
